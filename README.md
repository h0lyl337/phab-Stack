🐍 PHaB Stack

PHaB (Python + HTML + and + Brython) is a full-stack Python web starter kit that combines Flask, Brython, HTML/CSS, and SQL into a single cohesive framework.
It lets you write Python on both the client and server, giving you a seamless development experience without switching to JavaScript for front-end interactivity.

✨ Features

🔐 User authentication — built-in login and registration system

🗄️ Database integration — uses SQL (SQLite by default) for persistent data

⚙️ Flask backend — clean, modular RESTful structure

🧠 Brython frontend — write interactive browser logic in Python instead of JS

🎨 HTML/CSS templates — easy to customize and extend

🚀 Full-stack ready — everything you need to build, test, and deploy

🧩 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology	Purpose
Frontend	HTML/CSS + Brython	UI and client-side Python logic
Backend	Flask (Python)	Routes, APIs, and server logic
Database	SQL / SQLite	Persistent data storage

🧰 Use Cases

Here’s where the PHaB Stack shines:

Scenario	Description
🧑‍💻 Learning Full-Stack Development	Ideal for students or devs who want to understand how frontend, backend, and database connect — all in Python.
🚀 Prototyping / MVPs	Quickly launch working web apps with authentication and a database — no JS setup required.
🧠 Teaching Web Concepts	Use PHaB to demonstrate HTTP requests, routing, and state management in a single language.
🧩 Internal Tools / Dashboards	Build admin panels or small-scale data-driven apps with minimal setup.
🧬 Experimenting with Brython	Great sandbox for exploring Python-in-the-browser alongside Flask.
🧡 The PHaB Philosophy

“Keep it Python, keep it simple, keep it PHaB.”
Full-stack web development doesn’t need to mean juggling five languages and endless dependencies — just write Python, front to back.
